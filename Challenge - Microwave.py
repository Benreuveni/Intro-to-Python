In the following exercise, we're going to program a Microwave!

Think about how a Microwave works in terms of the program it's running. It takes input in the form of numbers and
settings, and has various attributes that can be changed (such as power level).

So our Microwave needs to be able to accept input that will alter its function.

In terms of how it will run, we won't be worried about how we interface with the program (although there is an example
of how to create a GUI box in the Stroop Experiment.py file you can use). If you're not feeling fancy, it's enough
to simply feed the arguments to the function when you call it.

Instead of firing radiation, and spinning plates of food, our microwave is simply going to print
the current settings (clock time & power level) one time when it starts,
and then "time remaining: ", and "ON" when working.

It's fine for the Time Remaining to be in arbitrary units OR if you're feeling ambitious, have it print the actual time
remaining in seconds (hint: this will require a clock check and some conditional logic).
