# Intro-to-Python
An intro to Coding and Experiment Building in Python

These files are meant to be semi-independent study material. It's best when done in a small group or 
with someone else who can help troubleshoot any problems you may encounter. That said, most of what you need
is provided.

These files are freely distributed under fair academic use. They should not be distributed for any sort of compensation without

Please note that this code was written for Python 2.7. There are minor compatability issues with Python 3, but it should all mostly be easily modifiable. View it as an additional challenge :)
